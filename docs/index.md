# Lightning UI Reference

Lightning-UI provides a set of components that are used very often when you are developing in Lightning, with the following components we hope to help you out with setting up your app a bit faster:

* [CollectionWrapper](CollectionWrapper/index.md)
    * [List](CollectionWrapper/List.md)
    * [Carousel](CollectionWrapper/Carousel.md)
    * [Grid](CollectionWrapper/Grid.md)


# Examples
In the following repository you can find code examples on how to use the components
